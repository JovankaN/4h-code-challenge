Fonts used are Google Fonts: Impact for headings and site title, Open Sans for body text

I've included PDFs and the Sketch file, you can download a trial version of Sketch if you don't have it here: https://www.sketchapp.com/

I'm looking for a basic HTML/CSS project. 

Feel free to include effects on interactions or bypass image - for example:

• you could use a CSS transition effect on links
• you might consider using Font Awesome for the trophy and other icons 

Some variation is fine, I am not necessarily looking for a pixel-perfect HTML page - more what solutions you employ and how your code is structured.

Please don't spend more than a few hours on this. If you need help, or have a question, feel free to get in touch with me!

Package up your project and send a zipped folder to me at: emily@chicagostyleseo.com with the subject line: CSS Code Challenge

Thank you!
